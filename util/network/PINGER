To test pinger and observe message loss.

cd $ROOT/util/network
cargo build --bin pinger

In first terminal: ./target/debug/pinger -l
In second terminal: ./target/debug/pinger -c

Wait for ~10 seconds and see printed output.

What is going on:

This is a program that implements devp2p subprotocol with rudimentary functionality.
On established connection both endpoints send 100 messages with packet_id=1
to each other. When message with packet_id<6 is received, counter corresponding to
this packet_id is increased and message with packet_id increased by one is sent back.
If all messages are delivered (and pinger is written correctly) counters for all
packet_id's in range 1..6 should be set to 100. Total of 1200 messages are being exchanged.

Other notes:  
1) Please note that in every 1..N chain of messages only last message, numbered N is sometimes lost.  
2) If sleeps are inserted and amount messages per second is small, no messages are being lost.  
3) This code has been tested on Linux and OSX. Problem does appear to be present only on Linux.
